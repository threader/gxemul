Comment:
 Originally contributed to OpenBSD by Nivas Madhur. Although it lacked an
 explicit notice, other files in the same change did have a notice:
 https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/be4a5d153bc5792d6fa724f2f244dd83a1b58a73
 From miod of the OpenBSD project, to Anders Gavare:
 | Since this file consists of #define for hardware registers and their
 | bits, using names coming straight from the Motorola documentation, it
 | hardly qualifies as copyrightable.
 | I don't think this file can be found in any tree with an explicit
 | copyright notice from Nivas. If this becomes a problem, you can try
 | switching to NetBSD sys/dev/mvme/pcctworeg.h, which has a clear
 | copyright notice but slightly different constant names.

Comment:
 Although the file is autogenerated, the only parts used are the
 #define'd hardware register constants. If one wanted to modify this
 file then one would not want to hunt down the tool from NetBSD, one
 would just modify it. The input to the generation tool can be found
 here, containing the copyright notice:
