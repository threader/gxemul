Description: machine emulator for multiple architectures
 GXemul aims at emulating complete machines with enough hardware
 emulated to run real unmodified operating systems. The emulation of
 these machine types is good enough to run a least one guest operating
 system:
 .
 ARM-based machines:
  * CATS (NetBSD/cats, OpenBSD/cats)
  * IQ80321 (NetBSD/evbarm)
  * NetWinder (NetBSD/netwinder)
 MIPS-based machines:
  * DECstation 5000/200 (NetBSD/pmax, OpenBSD/pmax, Ultrix, 
    Linux/DECstation, Sprite)
  * Acer Pica-61 (NetBSD/arc)
  * NEC MobilePro 770, 780, 800, 880 (NetBSD/hpcmips)
  * Malta (NetBSD/evbmips
  * Algorithmics P5064 (NetBSD/algor)
  * SGI O2 (aka IP32) (NetBSD/sgi) (enough for root-on-nfs)
 PowerPC-based machines:
  * IBM 6050/6070 (PReP, PowerPC Reference Platform) (NetBSD/prep)
 SuperH-based machines:
  * Sega Dreamcast (NetBSD/dreamcast) (enough for ramdisk userland)
 .
 Other machine types and architectures are emulated less completely.
 See the documentation in the gxemul-doc package for the exact details
 and guides to installing guest operating systems.

Description: gxemul documentation
 This package contains the documentation for gxemul, the machine
 emulator for multiple architectures. Among other things, instructions
 for how to get different guest operating systems running are
 included.
